## Sparse Autoencoder (PyTorch) to predict movie rates

#### Movie rate prediction based on a certain user 

#### 4-layer fully connected network and MSE error featuring weight decay of 0.5 to prevent overfitting 

#### 1M training sample for 200 epochs

#### In data preprocessing, data is converted based on one hot vector concept, where here is the simplified version of that for 3 movies and their rates are 4, 2 and 3

[[4 0 0],[0 2 0],[0 0 3]]
